            Heya!
            My name's Emily, and I'm a professional nerd. I've been drawing and telling stories since before I can remember,
            and I'm not always sure where to draw the line between them. The stuff I make has always been eclectic,
            I love to learn and experiment with new methods and styles. I like sticking things together in new ways,
            creating something new out of the juxtaposition.
            Making my fellow nerds laugh or smile has become something of a calling, and I hope you'll find something here that will brighten up your day!

                Professionally printed using my own art and designs, Sweet Ingenuity cards are then cut and folded by hand.
                Each one measure approximately 4.75 inches by 4.75 inches, with some minor variation due to their handmade nature.
                They're printed on sturdy cardstock, and are blank inside. The back features my logo and website, and the text "handmade in Ottawa,
                Canada by a real live human". Each card comes with a simple 5 inch by 5 inch ungummed white envelope.

                This print measures approximately 8.5 x 11 inches, and is printed on a bright and heavy gloss paper for durability and bright colours.
                It's sturdy enough to last well if cared for, but is not considered archival. Some prints have tiny dots of misplaced ink or other small
                glitches, a normal part of the printing process.

                I’ve now got all four of these listed in my shop’s printables section, for maximum cheesy nerdy Valentine’s goodness.
                 Each file is $2 CAD (so like $1.60 US ATM) and you can make as many as you want with your own home printer :)

                    While I focus primarily on my own artwork and commercial-use work-for-hire, I do occasionally take personal commissions too.
                    I almost always have chibi commissions available through my Etsy store, but when I open commissions in my more complex styles
                    my patrons will have first dibs.

                    <p>
                        I'm an author, freelance illustrator, and all-around geek.
                        I've been drawing and telling stories since before I can remember, and I'm not always sure where to draw the line between them.
                        The stuff I make has always been eclectic, I love to learn and experiment with new methods and styles. I love cute things,
                        but I'm also inspired by Victorian fashion and high fantasy, as well as modern pop culture.
                        I like sticking things together in new ways, creating something new out of the juxtaposition.
                        While I love drawing almost anything, I specialize in fantasy illustration.
